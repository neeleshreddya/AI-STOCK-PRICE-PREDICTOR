Personalized Healthcare Recommendations Using Deep Learning

This project uses a neural network model built with TensorFlow/Keras to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on health parameters. It then provides personalized healthcare recommendations based on the predicted risk level.
Dataset

The model is trained on a diabetes prediction dataset containing features like age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and smoking history.
Project Highlights

    Data preprocessing including encoding and normalization.
    Neural network model training and evaluation.
    Real-time healthcare recommendations by patient serial number.
    Accuracy visualization and classification metrics.

Dependencies
